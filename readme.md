Creating this to help explain my first repo on Github, as well as for the VBA files. Putting down the sources of where I found code to help keep track of what I've done and modified. Lots of things to do and change!

Reconsiderations
------------
- Add a way to print multiple copies of a file within "Print Files.vb"
- Possibly make "Copy Files.vb" more sensitive about directory searching so it doesn't take as long

End Notes
