Creating this [readme.md] to help explain my first Repo (hurryay!) on Github. Created these various tidbits during my time at the Department of Transportation to automate some repetitive tasks within my unit. Could have simplified the code to my desires but I want to put some fail safes for the future when others may use my applications. Putting down the sources of where I found code to help keep track of what I've done and modified. Lots of things to do and change!

Future Reconsiderations
------------
- Update Dismissal Create.vb to take in all the rows, and then loop through until the last row (aka no deletion of the row)
